# bibletags-usfm

This repo includes the usfm files used in [bibletags-data](https://github.com/educational-resources-and-services/bibletags-data) and [bibletags-react-native-app](https://github.com/educational-resources-and-services/bibletags-react-native-app).

These USFM 3.0 files are derived from [unfoldingword.org/uhb](https://unfoldingword.org/uhb) and [unfoldingword.org/ugnt](https://unfoldingword.org/ugnt).

The following changes have been made via the import scripts:

1. Variant information has been added to the end of all relevant verses using the custom `\zApparatusJson` tag. For critical texts, punctuation, accents, breathing marks, and capitalization are ignored, since these things are not present in the originals and thus do not represent a different reading or the ancient manuscripts. Also, refer to CNTR's [README](/cntr/transcriptions/%23README.txt) for information regarding the following special characters used to represent the reading quality of manuscripts: `%^=${}xab`.

##### Expanded and annotated `\zApparatusJson` example from Matthew 1:1

```json
{
  "words": [
    // Any time a plus character proceeds a single word or word range below, it means these words come from this `words` array.
    // Without the plus character, the word or word range comes from the UGNT.
    {
      "id": "40HX3",
      "w": "δαυιδ"
    },
    {
      "id": "404KI",
      "w": "δαβιδ"
    },
    "βιβλοσ",
    "γενεσεωσ",
    "=ιυ",
    "=χυ",
    "=υυ",
    "…",  // Ellipsis are used in place of supplied words.
    "=δαδ",
    "δα%υ^ε^ι%δ",
    "δαυετ",
    "γενεσενσ",
    "αβρα^α^μ^"
  ],
  "critical": [
    "WH",  // No colon indicates this text's reading matches the UGNT.
    "RP,KJTR,NA,SBL:1-5,+1,7-8",  // These text read the same as the UGNT for words 1-5 and 7-8. The sixth word is replaced with δαυιδ from the `words` array above.
    "ST:1-5,+2,7-8"  // The ST also has an alternate reading with the sixth word, but uses δαβιδ.
  ],
  "ancient": [
    "𝔓1:+3-7,+1,+8,8",
    "01:+3-6,5,+9,5,8",
    "03:+3-6,5-6,5,8",
    "032:+3-6,5,+10,5,8",
    "61617:+3-4,3-5,+11,5,8",
    "64853:+3,+12,+5-7,+9,+7,+13"
  ]
}
```

2. A unique `x-id` has been added to each word in the UGNT and each variant word represented in a critical text. Where the difference in a variant is merely the addition of brackets (to indicate uncertaintly), the `x-id` of that variant matches its counterpart in the UGNT.
