## About

*Original language Bible study for everyone, in every language.*

Vision: That every Christian might have free access to the Bible tagged to the original Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek with parsing and lexical information—all in their own language.

# bibletags-usfm

This repo includes the usfm files used in [bibletags-data](https://github.com/educational-resources-and-services/bibletags-data) and [bibletags-react-native-app](https://github.com/educational-resources-and-services/bibletags-react-native-app).

These USFM 3.0 files are derived from [unfoldingword.org/uhb](https://unfoldingword.org/uhb), [unfoldingword.org/ugnt](https://unfoldingword.org/ugnt) and [CCAT/lxxmorph](http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/gopher/text/religion/biblical/lxxmorph/).

The following changes have been made via the import scripts:

#### 1. Variant information has been added to the end of all relevant verses using the custom `\zApparatusJson` tag.

  - UHB
    - usfm footnotes with Qere and Ketiv readings have been replaced with the same info in `\zApparatusJson` tags, with `K` and `Q` listed as the source.
    - usfm footnotes indicating "some manuscripts read" (or the like) are have also been replaced with the same info in `\zApparatusJson` tags, with `M` listed as the source.
    - usfm footnotes indicating a BHS reading have also been replaced with the same info in `\zApparatusJson` tags, with `BHS` listed as the source.
    - When a verse does not have Qere and Ketiv readings but does have a `M` or `BHS` reading, the `\zApparatusJson` compares this reading with a source of `WLC`.
  - UGNT
    - For critical texts, punctuation, accents, breathing marks, and capitalization are ignored, since these things are not present in the originals and thus do not represent a different reading or the ancient manuscripts.
    - Refer to CNTR's [README](/cntr/transcriptions/%23README.txt) for information regarding the following special characters used to represent the reading quality of manuscripts: `%^=${}xab`.

##### Expanded and annotated `\zApparatusJson` example from Joshua 9:7

```json
{
  "words": [
    {
      "w": "וַיֹּ֥אמֶר",
      "id": "06zXI",
      "lemma": "אָמַר",
      "strong": "c:H05590",
      "morph": "He,C:Vqw3ms"
    },
    {
      "w": "אכרות",
      "id": "06iwU",
      "lemma": "כָּרַת",
      "strong": "H37720",
      "morph": "He,Vqi1cs"
    }
  ],
  "ancient": [],
  "critical": [
    "Q:+1,2-13",
    "K:1-10,+2,12-13"
  ]
}
```

##### Expanded and annotated `\zApparatusJson` example from Matthew 1:1

```json
{
  "words": [
    // Any time a plus character proceeds a single word or word range below, it means these words come from this `words` array.
    // Without the plus character, the word or word range comes from the UGNT.
    {
      "id": "40HX3",
      "w": "δαυιδ"
    },
    {
      "id": "404KI",
      "w": "δαβιδ"
    },
    "βιβλοσ",
    "γενεσεωσ",
    "=ιυ",
    "=χυ",
    "=υυ",
    "…",  // Ellipsis are used in place of supplied words.
    "=δαδ",
    "δα%υ^ε^ι%δ",
    "δαυετ",
    "γενεσενσ",
    "αβρα^α^μ^"
  ],
  "critical": [
    "WH",  // No colon indicates this text's reading matches the UGNT.
    "RP,KJTR,NA,SBL:1-5,+1,7-8",  // These text read the same as the UGNT for words 1-5 and 7-8. The sixth word is replaced with δαυιδ from the `words` array above.
    "ST:1-5,+2,7-8"  // The ST also has an alternate reading with the sixth word, but uses δαβιδ.
  ],
  "ancient": [
    "𝔓1:+3-7,+1,+8,8",
    "01:+3-6,5,+9,5,8",
    "03:+3-6,5-6,5,8",
    "032:+3-6,5,+10,5,8",
    "61617:+3-4,3-5,+11,5,8",
    "64853:+3,+12,+5-7,+9,+7,+13"
  ]
}
```

#### 2. A unique `x-id` has been added to each word in the UHB and UGNT and each variant word represented in a critical text.

  - UHB
    - All Ketiv/Qere variants are given a unique `x-id`, even if they possess the same lemma, strong, and morph values.
  - UGNT
    - Where the difference in a variant is merely the addition of brackets (to indicate uncertaintly), the `x-id` of that variant matches its counterpart in the UGNT.

#### 3. (UHB only) Alternative versification (indicated by `\va` and `\ca` tags) has been made the standard versification (using `\v` and `\c` tags).

#### 4. (UHB only) Strongs numbers have been converted to five-digit notation to match the UGNT.

- Eg. `H1254a` is now `H12541`
- Where no letter was present, `0` has been appended. The letter `a` has been replaced with `1`, `b` with `2`, etc.

#### 5. (UHB only) The `יָלַךְ`/`H32120` lemma/strongs combo has been changed to `הָלַךְ`/`H19800` as modern scholars no longer recognize a distinct `יָלַךְ` lemma.

#### 6. (UHB only) Words with multi-word lemmas have been combined together.

- Eg. Before and after (from Genesis 21:14)

```
BEFORE
\w בְּאֵ֥ר|lemma="בְּאֵר שֶׁבַע" strong="H08840" x-morph="He,Np"\w*
\w שָֽׁבַע|lemma="בְּאֵר שֶׁבַע" strong="H08840" x-morph="He,Np"\w*׃

AFTER
\w בְּאֵ֥ר שָֽׁבַע|lemma="בְּאֵר שֶׁבַע" strong="H08840" x-morph="He,Np" x-id="01fFu"\w*׃
```

#### 7. (UHB only) Added a `\p` after each verse-ending פ (petucha).

#### 8. (UHB only) The lemma and strongs for `אֲרָם` when a part of the place name `פַּדָּן אֲרָם` have been changed to `אֲרָם` and `#H07580` respectively.

- This modification was preferred to combining this word together with `פַּדָּן` as a multi-word lemma, since `פַּדָּן` sometimes takes a directional ה suffix.

#### 9. (UGNT only) Fixed the lemma and strongs in several places where `Χριστιανός` was incorrectly indicated. (See [this commit](https://github.com/educational-resources-and-services/bibletags-usfm/commit/08a4b56e92662e4e80d6539cd023d0e4dd657603).)

#### 10. (LXX only) Added Strongs numbers where missing.

- For the most part, missings strongs were due to that word not appearing in the GNT. In such cases, a strongs number starting with `G60000` was added.
- In other cases, the Strongs number was identified by comparing the lemma to an existing Strongs entry.

#### 11. (LXX only) Converted the morphology to match that of the UGNT.
